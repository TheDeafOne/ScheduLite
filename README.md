# SchedLite
Schedulite is an online, open-source course scheduler.
## Installation
This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), meaning it contains multiple projects (two in our case). These are the frontend and backend to ScheduLite. We do this for ease of use and maintanence â€“ at the cost of a more involved installation process.\
Our tech stack consists of the following tools and frameworks:
### Front End
* React
* Node.js
* npm
### Back End
* SpringBoot
* Gradle
